    description={["I studied at DuocUC, a professional institute in Santiago, Chile, where I completed a 4-year degree in Computer Engineering. During this program, I learned about various fields, but I focused on web and mobile development, which is what Iâ€™m most passionate about. Today, I continue to study on my own and learn every day. I am currently waiting to begin my web developer diploma at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile."]}
